# Babbler

## What is it?

This plugin aims to make NPC speech more immersive by having them "babble" (think Animal Crossing, or The Sims) when they talk. This can be either when they are talking near you or in direct conversations with them. There are configuration settings to control when and how they babble.

## Installation

### r2modman or Thunderstore Mod Manager installation

If you are using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/oneapp/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) for installation, simply download the mod from the Online tab.

### Manual installation

Follow these steps:

1. Download BepInEx from the official repository.
2. Extract the downloaded files into the same folder as the "Shadows of Doubt.exe" executable.
3. Launch the game, load the main menu, and then exit the game.
4. Download the latest version of the plugin from the Releases page. Unzip the files and place them in corresponding directories within "Shadows of Doubt\BepInEx...". Also, download the [SOD.Common](https://thunderstore.io/c/shadows-of-doubt/p/Venomaus/SODCommon/) dependency.
5. Start the game.
