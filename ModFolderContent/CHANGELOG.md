# CHANGELOG
**0.9.0**
- Added Synthesis mode, which uses text to speech. This is now the default, because it's great.
- Added Droning mode, which is inspired by the speech in "Undertale". It's phonetic but only using one repeating syllable.
- Added eight more sets of phonetic voices, which work in both Phonetic and Droning mode.
- Added a lot of configuration options.
- Added a volume increase when NPCs "shout" in all caps.
- Fixed some errors the plugin was throwing by moving initialization of FMOD into the main menu.

**0.8.1**
- Fix Thunderstore breaking my directory structure, add some more sanity checks.

**0.8.0**
- Initial release
  - Citizens now babble when they talk, whether it's straight to you, near you, or over the phone.
